.meals {
    width: 90%;
    max-width: 90rem;
    display: grid;
    grid-template-columns: repeat(auto-fill, minmax(20rem, 1fr));
    grid-gap: 5rem;
    margin: 2rem auto;
    list-style: none;
    padding: 0;

/** 
  
Here's how the  CSS works to create a responsive grid layout for the MealsGrid component:
  
1. The ul Element Styled as a Grid Container

    The ul element with the class meals is styled to act as a CSS Grid container. 
    The grid layout is defined using the following properties:
    display: grid;

    Sets the layout model to CSS Grid for the ul element, 
    enabling grid-based positioning for its child elements (li).


2. Defining Columns with grid-template-columns
    grid-template-columns: repeat(auto-fill, minmax(20rem, 1fr));

    repeat(auto-fill, ...): Automatically creates as many columns as 
    possible based on the container's width and the specified size constraints.

    Ensures each column is at least 20rem wide.
    If there's extra space, the column can expand up to a fraction (1fr) of the available space.


    Effect:

    Columns dynamically adjust based on the screen size and container width.
    The grid remains responsive, filling the available space with as many 20rem minimum-width items as possible.

3. Spacing Between Grid Items
    grid-gap: 5rem;

    Adds a uniform gap of 5rem between grid items (both rows and columns).


4. Centering the Grid and Setting Its Width
    width: 90%;
    max-width: 90rem;
    margin: 2rem auto;

    width: 90%;: Sets the grid's width to 90% of the viewport or parent container.

    max-width: 90rem;: Limits the grid's maximum width to 90rem, ensuring it doesnâ€™t 
    stretch too wide on large screens.

    margin: 2rem auto;: Centers the grid horizontally (using auto for left/right margins) 
    and adds 2rem vertical spacing.


5. Removing List Style
    list-style: none;
    padding: 0;

    list-style: none;: Removes default bullet points from the ul list.
    padding: 0;: Removes default padding from the ul, ensuring a clean alignment.
